Hi!<br>
I’m @freebirdATL.

I'm a physics major turned financial analyst turned software engineer turned  teacher ...<br>
... there were many steps during that transition (and I'm still learning!).<br><br>
Which means, if you find yourself in the wrong career path and need to move, I'd love to share my experience .<br><br>
